It consists of 900,042 rows, each representing a unique event, and is structured with 4 distinct attributes.\n\nThe first attribute, **W_C_ID**, appears to be an identifier for the customer or user who performed the action. This allows for tracking of individual user behavior within the system.\n\nThe second attribute, **W_S_SYMB**, likely represents a symbol or code associated with the content or item that was the subject of the watch event. This could be used to identify what exactly the user was interacting with at the time of the event.\n\nThe third attribute, **W_DTS**, is a timestamp indicating the exact date and time when the watch event occurred. This temporal data is crucial for understanding the sequence and timing of user actions.\n\nFinally, the fourth attribute, **W_ACTION**, describes the type of action that was taken by the user, such as 'ACTV' which might stand for 'active' or 'activate', suggesting that the user engaged with the content in some way.\n\nTogether, these attributes provide a comprehensive overview of user engagement events, tracking who did what, with which item, and when."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Watch History Event": {"Customer": {"Identifier": ["W_C_ID"]}, "Event": {"Details": ["W_S_SYMB", "W_DTS", "W_ACTION"]}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "W_C_ID"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "W_S_SYMB"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "W_ACTION"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "W_DTS"}]}, "missing_value": {"W_C_ID": {}, "W_S_SYMB": {}, "W_DTS": {}, "W_ACTION": {}}, "unusual": {"W_C_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "W_S_SYMB": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "The values are unusual because they are excessively long and not easily recognizable as typical security symbols.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "W_DTS": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "W_ACTION": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}}, "recommend_testing": [{"name": "Valid DateTime Check", "reasoning": "The W_DTS column should contain valid date-time strings in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_watch_history WHERE W_DTS NOT LIKE '____-__-__ __:__:__'"}, {"name": "Valid Action Check", "reasoning": "The W_ACTION column should only contain the values 'ACTV' or 'CNCL'.", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_watch_history WHERE W_ACTION NOT IN ('ACTV', 'CNCL')"}, {"name": "Unique Combination Check", "reasoning": "There should be no duplicate entries for the combination of W_C_ID, W_S_SYMB, and W_DTS.", "sql": "SELECT W_C_ID, W_S_SYMB, W_DTS, COUNT(*) FROM src_watch_history GROUP BY W_C_ID, W_S_SYMB, W_DTS HAVING COUNT(*) > 1"}]}
