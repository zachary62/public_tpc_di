Contact details are further specified with attributes like **ADDRESS_LINE1**, **ADDRESS_LINE2**, **POSTAL_CODE**, **CITY**, **STATE**, **COUNTRY**, and **PHONE**.\n\nFinancial and asset-related information is captured in attributes such as **INCOME**, **NUMBER_CARS**, **NUMBER_CHILDREN**, **MARITAL_STATUS**, **AGE**, **CREDIT_RATING**, **OWN_OR_RENT_FLAG**, **EMPLOYER**, **NUMBER_CREDIT_CARDS**, and **NET_WORTH**. These attributes provide insights into the economic status and purchasing power of the prospect.\n\nThe **MARITAL_STATUS** attribute indicates the social aspect of the prospect, while **AGE** provides demographic information. The **CREDIT_RATING** and **OWN_OR_RENT_FLAG** can be used to assess the creditworthiness and housing status of the individual. The **EMPLOYER** attribute may give an indication of the prospect's employment status and possibly their stability or professional field.\n\nOverall, the table 'dim_prospect' is a comprehensive collection of data points that can be used to understand the profile of potential clients, assess their financial capacity, and tailor marketing or sales strategies accordingly.
