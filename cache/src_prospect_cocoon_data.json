The **AGENCY_ID** attribute identifies the agency associated with the prospect, while personal details such as **LAST_NAME**, **FIRST_NAME**, and **MIDDLE_INITIAL** offer a way to address the prospects individually. The **GENDER** attribute indicates the gender of each prospect.\n\nContact information is captured through attributes like **ADDRESS_LINE1**, **ADDRESS_LINE2**, **POSTAL_CODE**, **CITY**, **STATE**, **COUNTRY**, and **PHONE**, ensuring that the agency can reach out to the prospect through various means. The financial situation of a prospect is reflected in attributes such as **INCOME**, **NUMBER_CARS**, **NUMBER_CHILDREN**, **MARITAL_STATUS**, **AGE**, **CREDIT_RATING**, **OWN_OR_RENT_FLAG**, **EMPLOYER**, **NUMBER_CREDIT_CARDS**, and **NET_WORTH**. These attributes provide insights into the prospect's economic status, responsibilities, and potential for financial engagement.\n\nThe **MARITAL_STATUS** and **AGE** attributes can be used to understand the life stage and social demographics of the prospect, which might influence their needs and preferences. The **CREDIT_RATING** and **OWN_OR_RENT_FLAG** give an indication of the prospect's creditworthiness and housing status, which are crucial for assessing their potential as clients. The **EMPLOYER** attribute could be used to gauge the stability of their employment, while the **NUMBER_CREDIT_CARDS** and **NET_WORTH** offer additional details on their financial health and spending power.\n\nIn summary, the 'src_prospect' table serves as a detailed repository of prospect information, which can be utilized by the agency to tailor their services and marketing efforts to the individual needs and characteristics of each potential client."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Prospect": {"Personal Information": {"Name": ["LAST_NAME", "FIRST_NAME", "MIDDLE_INITIAL"], "Demographics": ["GENDER", "AGE", "MARITAL_STATUS"], "Contact": ["PHONE", "ADDRESS_LINE1", "ADDRESS_LINE2", "POSTAL_CODE", "CITY", "STATE", "COUNTRY"]}, "Financial Information": {"Income and Wealth": ["INCOME", "NET_WORTH"], "Credit": ["CREDIT_RATING", "NUMBER_CREDIT_CARDS"], "Ownership": ["OWN_OR_RENT_FLAG", "NUMBER_CARS"]}, "Family Information": {"Dependents": ["NUMBER_CHILDREN"]}, "Employment Information": {"Employment": ["EMPLOYER"]}, "Identification": {"Agency": ["AGENCY_ID"]}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "GENDER"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "MARITAL_STATUS"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "AGE"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "INCOME"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "CREDIT_RATING"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "NUMBER_CARS"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "NUMBER_CHILDREN"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "OWN_OR_RENT_FLAG"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "NUMBER_CREDIT_CARDS"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "NET_WORTH"}]}, "missing_value": {"AGENCY_ID": {}, "LAST_NAME": {}, "FIRST_NAME": {}, "MIDDLE_INITIAL": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "GENDER": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "ADDRESS_LINE1": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight or deemed unnecessary"}, "ADDRESS_LINE2": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight or deemed unnecessary"}, "POSTAL_CODE": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight or deemed unnecessary"}, "CITY": {}, "STATE": {}, "COUNTRY": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight or deemed unnecessary"}, "PHONE": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to share"}, "INCOME": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "NUMBER_CARS": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "NUMBER_CHILDREN": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "MARITAL_STATUS": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "AGE": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "CREDIT_RATING": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individuals chose not to disclose"}, "OWN_OR_RENT_FLAG": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "EMPLOYER": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}, "NUMBER_CREDIT_CARDS": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individuals chose not to disclose"}, "NET_WORTH": {"summary": "Non-Response: Individual chose not to disclose"}}, "unusual": {"AGENCY_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "The value 'O'L54' is unusual because it contains an apostrophe.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "LAST_NAME": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "Values like 'todo', 'onsiteteam', 'Projects', 'Irc' are unusual because they do not seem to be actual last names and could be placeholders or errors.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "FIRST_NAME": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "MIDDLE_INITIAL": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "Lowercase letters such as 'c', 'y', 'j' are unusual because initials are typically uppercase.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "GENDER": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "Single letters and non-standard abbreviations are unusual because they do not typically represent gender identities in a recognizable format.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "ADDRESS_LINE1": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "ADDRESS_LINE2": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "POSTAL_CODE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CITY": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "STATE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "COUNTRY": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "PHONE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "Values starting with '1-0' and '1-1' are unusual because area codes and central office codes should not start with '0' or '1' in the NANP.
