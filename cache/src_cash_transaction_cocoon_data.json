It consists of 361856 rows, each representing an individual transaction, and is structured with 4 columns that detail specific attributes of these transactions.\n\nThe first attribute, **CT_CA_ID**, appears to be an identifier for the customer or account associated with the transaction. This field is likely used to link the cash movement to a specific entity within the database.\n\nNext, the attribute **CT_DTS** provides a timestamp for when the transaction occurred. This is crucial for maintaining an accurate and chronological record of all cash movements, allowing for temporal analysis and auditing.\n\nThe third attribute, **CT_AMT**, indicates the amount of cash that was transacted. The negative values in the examples suggest that these transactions might be withdrawals or payments, representing money flowing out of the account.\n\nLastly, **CT_NAME** seems to be a descriptor or reference for the transaction. This could include information about the transaction's nature, the payee, or any other relevant details that could be used for identification or verification purposes.\n\nIn summary, the 'src_cash_transaction' table provides a comprehensive log of cash transactions, detailing the **CT_CA_ID** for account identification, the **CT_DTS** for the date and time of the transaction, the **CT_AMT** for the transaction amount, and the **CT_NAME** for transaction description or reference."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Cash Transaction": {"Transaction": {"Details": ["CT_DTS", "CT_AMT", "CT_NAME"]}, "Customer Account": {"Identifier": ["CT_CA_ID"]}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "CT_CA_ID"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "CT_DTS"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "CT_AMT"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "CT_NAME"}]}, "missing_value": {"CT_CA_ID": {}, "CT_DTS": {}, "CT_AMT": {}, "CT_NAME": {}}, "unusual": {"CT_CA_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CT_DTS": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CT_AMT": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CT_NAME": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "The values are unusual because they are excessively long, lack structure, and contain spaces and special characters, which are not typical for transaction identifiers or descriptions.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}}, "recommend_testing": [{"name": "Unique Transaction Name Check", "reasoning": "Each transaction should have a unique name to ensure there are no duplicates", "sql": "SELECT CT_NAME, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count FROM src_cash_transaction GROUP BY CT_NAME HAVING COUNT(*) > 1"}, {"name": "Non-zero Transaction Amount Check", "reasoning": "Transaction amounts should not be zero, indicating that a transaction has occurred", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_cash_transaction WHERE CT_AMT = 0"}, {"name": "Future-dated Transaction Check", "reasoning": "Transactions should not have a date in the future relative to the data extraction date", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_cash_transaction WHERE CT_DTS > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"}]}
