The table 'src_hr' consists of 15000 rows, indicating that there are 15000 unique entries or records of employees. Each record is detailed across 9 columns, representing different attributes associated with the employees.\n\nThe first attribute, **EMPLOYEE_ID**, serves as a unique identifier for each employee within the table. It is followed by **MANAGER_ID**, which indicates the supervisory relationship, linking each employee to their respective manager. Personal details of the employees are captured through attributes such as **EMPLOYEE_FIRST_NAME** and **EMPLOYEE_LAST_NAME**, which store the first and last names of the employees, respectively. In cases where an employee has a middle initial, it would be recorded under **EMPLOYEE_MI**, although this field is empty for the first two rows shown.\n\nThe professional role of each employee is denoted by the **EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE**, which is likely a unique code representing the job position or title within the company. The **EMPLOYEE_BRANCH** attribute specifies the branch of the organization where the employee is based, while **EMPLOYEE_OFFICE** indicates the specific office number or location identifier within that branch. Lastly, the **EMPLOYEE_PHONE** attribute provides a contact number for the employee, allowing for communication within or outside the company.\n\nIn summary, the table provides a comprehensive overview of employees, their managerial relationships, personal names, job roles, workplace locations, and contact information, all of which are essential for human resource management and internal administrative processes."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Employee": {"Personal Information": {"Name": ["EMPLOYEE_FIRST_NAME", "EMPLOYEE_LAST_NAME", "EMPLOYEE_MI"]}, "Contact": {"Details": ["EMPLOYEE_PHONE"]}, "Work": {"Identification": ["EMPLOYEE_ID", "MANAGER_ID"], "Job": ["EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE"], "Location": ["EMPLOYEE_BRANCH", "EMPLOYEE_OFFICE"]}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "EMPLOYEE_BRANCH"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "MANAGER_ID"}]}, "missing_value": {"EMPLOYEE_ID": {}, "MANAGER_ID": {}, "EMPLOYEE_FIRST_NAME": {}, "EMPLOYEE_LAST_NAME": {}, "EMPLOYEE_MI": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight during data collection"}, "EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE": {"summary": "Non-Response: Employee chose not to disclose"}, "EMPLOYEE_BRANCH": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight during data collection"}, "EMPLOYEE_OFFICE": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight during data collection"}, "EMPLOYEE_PHONE": {"summary": "Non-Response: Employee chose not to share"}}, "unusual": {"EMPLOYEE_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "MANAGER_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "EMPLOYEE_FIRST_NAME": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "Values like 'DataSupport', 'Prodmgmt', and 'VMXA' are unusual because they do not resemble personal names and may indicate placeholders or system entries rather than actual employee first names.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "EMPLOYEE_LAST_NAME": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "EMPLOYEE_MI": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "EMPLOYEE_BRANCH": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "The values are unusual because they lack a consistent format and contain random sequences of characters, which is not typical for organizational identifiers.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "EMPLOYEE_OFFICE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "EMPLOYEE_PHONE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}}, "recommend_testing": [{"name": "Manager Existence Check", "reasoning": "Every employee should have a manager, and the manager's ID should exist within the employee ID range or be a known manager ID outside the range.", "sql": "select * from src_hr where MANAGER_ID not in (select distinct EMPLOYEE_ID from src_hr) and MANAGER_ID > 1500"}, {"name": "Employee Name Completeness Check", "reasoning": "Every employee should have both a first and a last name.", "sql": "select * from src_hr where EMPLOYEE_FIRST_NAME = '' or EMPLOYEE_LAST_NAME = ''"}, {"name": "Employee Middle Initial Check", "reasoning": "If an employee has a middle initial, it should be a single character.", "sql": "select * from src_hr where length(EMPLOYEE_MI) > 1"}, {"name": "Employee Job Code Validity Check", "reasoning": "Employee job codes should be within the known range of job codes.", "sql": "select * from src_hr where EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE < 47 or EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE > 658"}, {"name": "Employee Branch Uniqueness Check", "reasoning": "Each employee should be associated with a unique branch.", "sql": "select EMPLOYEE_BRANCH, count(*) as cnt from src_hr group by EMPLOYEE_BRANCH having cnt > 1"}, {"name": "Employee Office Uniqueness Check", "reasoning": "Each employee should be associated with a unique office.", "sql": "select EMPLOYEE_OFFICE, count(*) as cnt from src_hr group by EMPLOYEE_OFFICE having cnt > 1"}, {"name": "Employee Phone Uniqueness Check", "reasoning": "Each employee should have a unique phone number.", "sql": "select EMPLOYEE_PHONE, count(*) as cnt from src_hr group by EMPLOYEE_PHONE having cnt > 1"}]}
