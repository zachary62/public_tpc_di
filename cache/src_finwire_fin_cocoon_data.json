The **pts** attribute indicates the precise timestamp when the data was recorded, offering a historical perspective starting from the year 1967. The **year** and **quarter** attributes denote the fiscal year and quarter to which the financial data corresponds, while the **quarter_start_date** and **posting_date** provide specific dates for the beginning of the quarter and when the financial data was posted, respectively.\n\nFinancial performance is represented through attributes such as **revenue**, which shows the total income generated by the company, and **earnings**, reflecting the company's profit after expenses. The **eps** (earnings per share) and **diluted_eps** (diluted earnings per share) offer insights into the company's profitability on a per-share basis, with the latter considering potential shares from convertible securities. The **margin** attribute indicates the profit margin, a measure of profitability in relation to revenue.\n\nThe table also includes data on the company's balance sheet, with **inventory** representing the value of goods available for sale, **assets** showing the total value of everything the company owns, and **liabilities** detailing the company's debts and obligations. Shareholder information is captured in **sh_out** (shares outstanding) and **diluted_sh_out** (diluted shares outstanding), which provide a count of the company's shares currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company\u2019s officers and insiders, with the latter adjusted for potential dilution.\n\nThe **co_name_or_cik** attribute identifies the company either by name or by its Central Index Key (CIK), a unique identifier assigned by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lastly, the **year_extracted** and **quarter_extracted** attributes confirm the fiscal year and quarter from which the data was sourced, ensuring the information's relevance and accuracy for the specified reporting period."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Company Financial Report": {"Report Identification": {"General Info": ["pts", "co_name_or_cik"], "Report Timing": ["year", "quarter", "quarter_start_date", "posting_date", "year_extracted", "quarter_extracted"]}, "Financial Data": {"Income Statement": ["revenue", "earnings", "eps", "diluted_eps", "margin"], "Balance Sheet": ["inventory", "assets", "liabilities"]}, "Equity Data": {"Share Information": ["sh_out", "diluted_sh_out"]}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "revenue"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "earnings"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "eps"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "diluted_eps"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "margin"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "inventory"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "assets"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "liabilities"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "sh_out"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "diluted_sh_out"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "year"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "quarter"}]}, "missing_value": {"pts": {}, "year": {}, "quarter": {}, "quarter_start_date": {}, "posting_date": {}, "revenue": {}, "earnings": {}, "eps": {}, "diluted_eps": {}, "margin": {}, "inventory": {}, "assets": {}, "liabilities": {}, "sh_out": {}, "diluted_sh_out": {}, "co_name_or_cik": {}, "year_extracted": {}, "quarter_extracted": {}}, "unusual": {"pts": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "year": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "quarter": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "quarter_start_date": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "posting_date": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "revenue": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "earnings": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "eps": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "diluted_eps": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "margin": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "inventory": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "assets": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "liabilities": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "sh_out": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "diluted_sh_out": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "co_name_or_cik": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "Values with long strings of characters and whitespace are unusual because they do not conform to the standard CIK format or recognizable company names.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "year_extracted": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "quarter_extracted": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}}, "recommend_testing": [{"name": "Quarter Start and Posting Date Consistency", "reasoning": "The quarter start date should be less than or equal to the posting date", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where quarter_start_date > posting_date"}, {"name": "Year and Quarter Extraction Consistency", "reasoning": "The extracted year and quarter should match the year and quarter in the date fields", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where year != year_extracted or 'Q' || quarter::text != quarter_extracted"}, {"name": "Earnings to Revenue Ratio", "reasoning": "Earnings should not exceed revenue", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where earnings > revenue"}, {"name": "EPS Calculation Consistency", "reasoning": "EPS (Earnings Per Share) should be consistent with earnings and shares outstanding", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where abs(earnings / sh_out - eps) > 0.01"}, {"name": "Diluted EPS Calculation Consistency", "reasoning": "Diluted EPS should be consistent with earnings and diluted shares outstanding", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where abs(earnings / diluted_sh_out - diluted_eps) > 0.01"}, {"name": "Assets and Liabilities Consistency", "reasoning": "Assets should be greater than or equal to liabilities", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where liabilities > assets"}, {"name": "Share Count Consistency", "reasoning": "Diluted shares outstanding should be greater than or equal to basic shares outstanding", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where sh_out > diluted_sh_out"}, {"name": "Margin Calculation Consistency", "reasoning": "Margin should be consistent with earnings and revenue", "sql": "select * from src_finwire_fin where abs(earnings / revenue - margin) > 0.01"}]}
