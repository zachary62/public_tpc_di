It contains 8023 rows and 7 columns, indicating a substantial number of customer account records. Each row in the table corresponds to a unique customer account entry.\n\nThe first attribute, **C_ID**, likely stands for Customer ID, which is a unique identifier for each customer. The second attribute, **CA_ID**, represents the Customer Account ID, which is a unique identifier for the customer's account. These two attributes establish the fundamental relationship between a customer and their account.\n\nThe next two attributes, **C_LCL_TX_ID** and **C_NAT_TX_ID**, could be identifiers for transactions at a local and national level, respectively. However, the provided rows do not contain data for these columns, suggesting that this information might be optional or not always applicable.\n\nThe **CA_TAX_ST** attribute probably indicates the tax status of the customer account, which is essential for financial and regulatory purposes. The value '1.0' in the provided rows might represent a specific tax status.\n\nThe **CA_B_ID** attribute is likely the Branch ID, which connects the customer account to a specific bank branch, denoted by the numerical values such as '8864.0' and '8918.0'. This linkage is crucial for understanding the geographical and operational aspects of the customer account.\n\nLastly, the **CA_NAME** attribute holds the name associated with the customer account, which is a string of characters that could be a coded or encrypted representation of the actual name for privacy or security reasons.\n\nIn summary, the 'dim_customer_account' table provides a structured overview of customer accounts, linking each account to a customer, transaction identifiers, tax status, bank branch, and an encoded name, all of which are critical for managing customer information in a banking or financial context."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Customer Account": {"Customer": {"Attributes": ["C_ID"]}, "Account": {"Attributes": ["CA_ID", "C_LCL_TX_ID", "C_NAT_TX_ID", "CA_TAX_ST", "CA_NAME"], "Bank": {"Attributes": ["CA_B_ID"]}}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "CA_TAX_ST"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "CA_B_ID"}]}, "missing_value": {"C_ID": {}, "CA_ID": {"summary": "Not Collected: Information deemed unnecessary initially"}, "C_LCL_TX_ID": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight or deemed unnecessary"}, "C_NAT_TX_ID": {"summary": "Not Collected: Oversight or deemed unnecessary"}, "CA_TAX_ST": {"summary": "Not Collected: Data not gathered initially"}, "CA_B_ID": {"summary": "Not Collected: Data not gathered initially"}, "CA_NAME": {"summary": "Not Collected: Information deemed unnecessary initially"}}, "unusual": {"C_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CA_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "C_LCL_TX_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "C_NAT_TX_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CA_TAX_ST": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CA_B_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "CA_NAME": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "Values such as 'nDFyJJlVxQrNWgSrMoEFAJisakJiTStcLwIsiIWRCNLyguBC' and 'egrGPAUCdkXECvuNLBZYbFwkpcaOJDUvJNOMiT' are unusual because they do not resemble typical account names or descriptions and contain a mix of random characters, which is not expected in this context.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}}, "recommend_testing": [{"name": "Unique Customer Account Name Check", "reasoning": "Each customer account name should be unique to ensure that there are no duplicates", "sql": "SELECT CA_NAME, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count FROM dim_customer_account GROUP BY CA_NAME HAVING COUNT(*) > 1"}, {"name": "Referential Integrity Check for Customer ID", "reasoning": "Each customer ID in the customer account table should exist in the customer table", "sql": "SELECT ca.C_ID FROM dim_customer_account ca LEFT JOIN dim_customer c ON ca.C_ID = c.C_ID WHERE c.C_ID IS NULL"}, {"name": "Referential Integrity Check for Bank ID", "reasoning": "Each bank ID in the customer account table should exist in the bank table", "sql": "SELECT ca.CA_B_ID FROM dim_customer_account ca LEFT JOIN dim_bank b ON ca.CA_B_ID = b.B_ID WHERE b.B_ID IS NULL"}, {"name": "Customer Account Tax Status Check", "reasoning": "The tax status should be within the known range of values, typically 0 for non-taxable, 1 for taxable", "sql": "SELECT * FROM dim_customer_account WHERE CA_TAX_ST NOT IN (0, 1)"}, {"name": "Local and National Transaction ID Consistency Check", "reasoning": "If a local transaction ID is provided, a national transaction ID should also be provided, and vice versa", "sql": "SELECT * FROM dim_customer_account WHERE (C_LCL_TX_ID IS NOT NULL AND C_NAT_TX_ID IS NULL) OR (C_LCL_TX_ID IS NULL AND C_NAT_TX_ID IS NOT NULL)"}]}
