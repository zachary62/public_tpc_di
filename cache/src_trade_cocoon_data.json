It consists of 390978 rows and 14 columns, each row representing an individual trade transaction. The big picture here is that this table is likely used to track and analyze trade activities over time, providing insights into trading patterns, financial positions, and market behavior.\n\nThe primary identifier for each trade is the **T_ID**, which is a unique identifier for the transaction. The **T_DTS** attribute records the date and time when the trade took place, allowing for chronological analysis of trade data. The status of the trade is captured by **T_ST_ID**, indicating the current state of the transaction, such as completed or pending.\n\nThe type of trade is specified by **T_TT_ID**, which could denote whether it's a buy, sell, or other types of trade transactions. The **T_IS_CASH** attribute indicates whether the trade was a cash transaction or not. The security being traded is identified by **T_S_SYMB**, which is the symbol of the stock or asset.\n\nThe quantity of the asset traded is recorded in **T_QTY**, while the bid price at the time of the trade is in **T_BID_PRICE**. The account associated with the trade is referenced by **T_CA_ID**. The name of the executive who executed the trade is stored in **T_EXEC_NAME**.\n\nThe actual price at which the trade was executed is captured in **T_TRADE_PRICE**, which may differ from the bid price. The charges associated with the trade are listed under **T_CHRG**, while the commission fees are recorded in **T_COMM**. Lastly, any tax applicable to the transaction is noted in **T_TAX**.\n\nIn summary, the 'src_trade' table provides a detailed ledger of trade transactions, including identifiers, timestamps, statuses, types, financial details, and associated charges, which are essential for financial analysis and reporting."}, "column_grouping": {"summary": {"Trade": {"Identifiers": {"Trade_Information": ["T_ID", "T_DTS"]}, "Status": {"Trade_Status": ["T_ST_ID"]}, "Type": {"Trade_Type": ["T_TT_ID", "T_IS_CASH"]}, "Security": {"Security_Details": ["T_S_SYMB"]}, "Quantity": {"Trade_Quantity": ["T_QTY"]}, "Pricing": {"Trade_Pricing": ["T_BID_PRICE", "T_TRADE_PRICE"]}, "Execution": {"Execution_Details": ["T_EXEC_NAME"]}, "Customer_Account": {"Account_Details": ["T_CA_ID"]}, "Charges": {"Trade_Charges": ["T_CHRG", "T_COMM", "T_TAX"]}}}}, "visualization": {"summary": [{"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_ST_ID"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_TT_ID"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_IS_CASH"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_S_SYMB"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_QTY"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_BID_PRICE"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_TRADE_PRICE"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_CHRG"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_COMM"}, {"name": "Histogram", "params": "T_TAX"}]}, "missing_value": {"T_ID": {}, "T_DTS": {}, "T_ST_ID": {}, "T_TT_ID": {}, "T_IS_CASH": {}, "T_S_SYMB": {}, "T_QTY": {}, "T_BID_PRICE": {}, "T_CA_ID": {}, "T_EXEC_NAME": {}, "T_TRADE_PRICE": {"summary": "Not Applicable: Trade canceled, price irrelevant"}, "T_CHRG": {"summary": "Not Applicable: Trade cancelled, charges not applied"}, "T_COMM": {"summary": "Not Applicable: Trade cancelled, no commission"}, "T_TAX": {"summary": "Not Applicable: Trade cancelled, no tax applicable"}}, "unusual": {"T_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_DTS": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_ST_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_TT_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_IS_CASH": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_S_SYMB": {"summary": {"Unusualness": true, "Examples": "The values are unusual because they are excessively long and start with a repetitive series of 'A's, which is not typical for standard security symbols.", "Explanation": "Unclear"}}, "T_QTY": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_BID_PRICE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_CA_ID": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_EXEC_NAME": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_TRADE_PRICE": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_CHRG": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_COMM": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}, "T_TAX": {"summary": {"Unusualness": false, "Examples": ""}}}, "recommend_testing": [{"name": "Trade Price and Bid Price Relationship", "reasoning": "The trade price should be at least the bid price or higher, since the bid price is the maximum price the buyer is willing to pay", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_TRADE_PRICE < T_BID_PRICE"}, {"name": "Cash Trade Check", "reasoning": "If the trade is a cash trade (T_IS_CASH = 1), then there should be no charge, commission, or tax applied", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_IS_CASH = 1 AND (T_CHRG <> 0 OR T_COMM <> 0 OR T_TAX <> 0)"}, {"name": "Non-Cash Trade Financials", "reasoning": "If the trade is not a cash trade (T_IS_CASH = 0), then there should be a charge, commission, or tax applied", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_IS_CASH = 0 AND T_CHRG = 0 AND T_COMM = 0 AND T_TAX = 0"}, {"name": "Trade Quantity Positive", "reasoning": "The trade quantity should always be a positive number", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_QTY <= 0"}, {"name": "Completed Trade Status", "reasoning": "If a trade has a status of 'CMPT' (completed), then the trade price should be greater than zero", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_ST_ID = 'CMPT' AND T_TRADE_PRICE <= 0"}, {"name": "Pending or Submitted Trade Status", "reasoning": "If a trade has a status of 'PNDG' (pending) or 'SBMT' (submitted), then the trade price should be zero as it has not been executed yet", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_ST_ID IN ('PNDG', 'SBMT') AND T_TRADE_PRICE <> 0"}, {"name": "Cancelled Trade Financials", "reasoning": "If a trade has been cancelled (T_ST_ID = 'CNCL'), there should be no charge, commission, or tax", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_ST_ID = 'CNCL' AND (T_CHRG <> 0 OR T_COMM <> 0 OR T_TAX <> 0)"}, {"name": "Trade Execution Name Check", "reasoning": "The trade execution name should be a positive number, representing an identifier for the entity that executed the trade", "sql": "SELECT * FROM src_trade WHERE T_EXEC_NAME <= 0"}]}
