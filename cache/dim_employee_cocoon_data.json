It consists of 15000 rows and 9 columns, each row representing a unique employee record.\n\nThe primary identifier for each employee is the **EMPLOYEE_ID**, which is a unique number assigned to every individual in the table. Employees are linked to their supervisors through the **MANAGER_ID**, indicating a hierarchical relationship within the organization.\n\nPersonal details of the employees are captured in attributes such as **EMPLOYEE_FIRST_NAME** and **EMPLOYEE_LAST_NAME**, which store the first and last names of the employees, respectively. In cases where an employee has a middle initial, it would be recorded in the **EMPLOYEE_MI** column, although the first two rows indicate that this field can be empty.\n\nEach employee's role is defined by the **EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE**, which is likely an alphanumeric code that corresponds to a specific job within the company. The **EMPLOYEE_BRANCH** attribute represents the branch or division of the organization where the employee works, and this is also represented by a unique code or identifier.\n\nThe location of the employee's office is specified in the **EMPLOYEE_OFFICE** attribute, which seems to be a code for different office locations, as seen in the first two rows with 'OFFICE7152' and 'OFFICE8586'.\n\nLastly, the **EMPLOYEE_PHONE** attribute provides a contact number for each employee, allowing for direct communication.\n\nIn summary, the 'dim_employee' table is a comprehensive collection of employee data, capturing both personal and professional details through attributes like **EMPLOYEE_ID**, **MANAGER_ID**, **EMPLOYEE_FIRST_NAME**, **EMPLOYEE_LAST_NAME**, **EMPLOYEE_MI**, **EMPLOYEE_JOB_CODE**, **EMPLOYEE_BRANCH**, **EMPLOYEE_OFFICE**, and **EMPLOYEE_PHONE**.
